# pale-signal

A lightweight, local-first Python tool for tracking and analyzing daily life signals using simple data and honest statistics.

## What this project IS

✅ A CLI-based Python project  
✅ Designed for one user (me)  
✅ Local-only: no cloud, no accounts, no syncing  
✅ Focused on daily quantitative signals, not journaling  
✅ Built to be usable in one afternoon, not "perfect"  
✅ A project to refine Python fundamentals, not showcase ML  
✅ A tool that outputs clear patterns, not motivational advice  

## What this project IS NOT

❌ Not a mental health app  
❌ Not a habit tracker  
❌ Not a productivity dashboard  
❌ Not a machine learning system  
❌ Not a web app or GUI  
❌ Not designed for multiple users  
❌ Not a data science demo or Kaggle-style analysis  
❌ Not an excuse to over-engineer  

**If a feature does not directly improve signal clarity, it does not belong.**

## Installation

```bash
# Clone or download this repository
cd pale-signal

# Activate virtual environment
.\venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage

### Add today's data
```bash
python pale_signal.py add
```

Interactive prompt collects:
- Sleep hours (0-24)
- Focus (1-10)
- Mood (1-10)
- Work hours (0-24)
- Social interaction (0=no, 1=yes)

### View summary statistics
```bash
# Last 30 days (default)
python pale_signal.py summary

# Last 7 days
python pale_signal.py summary --days 7
```

Displays:
- Averages for all metrics
- 7-day rolling averages
- Top correlations between metrics
- Threshold-based flags (low sleep, low focus, etc.)

### Plot a metric
```bash
python pale_signal.py plot sleep_hours
python pale_signal.py plot focus
python pale_signal.py plot mood
python pale_signal.py plot work_hours
python pale_signal.py plot social
```

Generates a time series plot with:
- Daily values
- 7-day rolling average
- Threshold reference lines
- Saved to `output/` directory (auto-created)

## Data Schema

All data is stored in `data.json` (gitignored for privacy):

```json
{
  "entries": [
    {
      "date": "2026-01-14",
      "sleep_hours": 7.5,
      "focus": 8,
      "mood": 7,
      "work_hours": 6.0,
      "social": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

**Tracked Signals (Final & Fixed):**
- `date` (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `sleep_hours` (float, 0-24)
- `focus` (int, 1-10)
- `mood` (int, 1-10)
- `work_hours` (float, 0-24)
- `social` (int, 0 or 1)

No additional signals unless one is removed.

## Philosophy

Daily internal states feel chaotic and subjective.  
This project converts them into structured data, simple statistics, and visible trends.

**The goal is not prediction — the goal is awareness through evidence.**

---

## Constraints (Non-Negotiable)

- Python only
- Command-line interface only
- JSON file storage
- No external databases
- No frameworks
- No ML libraries
- One command per execution
- One plot per visualization
- Code must remain readable in 3 months

---

## Definition of "Done"

The project is considered complete when:

✅ I can add daily data  
✅ I can view trends  
✅ The output gives at least one non-obvious insight  
✅ The tool feels usable, not impressive  

---

## Privacy

All personal data remains local. `data.json` is gitignored.  
This repository may be made public later without data.

## License

Personal project. Use at your own risk.
